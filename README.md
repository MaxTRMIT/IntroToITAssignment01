 <p> I have knowledge in Java, MySQL, HTML and CSS, I am planning on learning Python and JavaScript in the future.<br> 
In August 2017 when I was 14, I saved some money from my job, with this money I purchased the hardware needed to make an Ethereum mining rig. The mining rig was small (2x RX 570’s) but it really worked into my interest of computers, I have continued following computer hardware and software creation to this day.<br>

• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). 
<br>
Currently I am most interested in data centres, I feel that as our world has accepted technology and the population keeps growing, Data management is a field that will be in high demand.<br>
While I was in grade 4 I started getting interested in video games, through this I met some friends at school. One of these friends had a great understanding of software, especially for our age. Through him and videogames, I became interested in both software and hardware.<br>
I don’t have any professional experience in the IT field yet, however I have assembled computers for friends for a profit.

• Why did you choose to come to RMIT? <br>

• What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br>

I hope to improve my overall knowledge of IT, and get an understanding of what to expect in this profession.
